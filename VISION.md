# Vision for FlaskNova

## üåç Why FlaskNova?

FlaskNova exists to bring **modern API development patterns** (inspired by FastAPI) into the **Flask ecosystem** ‚Äî without forcing developers to abandon the libraries, flexibility, and ecosystem they already know.

## üéØ Goals

* Provide **FastAPI-like developer experience** while staying 100% Flask-compatible.
* Keep the framework **lightweight, modular, and extensible** ‚Äî only ship essentials, let developers plug in Flask libraries for extras.
* Ensure **production readiness**: proper error handling, logging, dependency injection, and schema validation out of the box.
* Promote **clean, maintainable APIs** with type hints, Pydantic/dataclass integration, and Swagger UI.

## üöÄ Roadmap (High-Level)

* Strengthen **developer experience** with better docs and examples.
* Explore **first-class async support** leveraging Flask\[async].
* Improve **Swagger/OpenAPI flexibility** (examples, tags, richer schema customization).
* Maintain **lean core philosophy** ‚Äî avoid bloating the framework by delegating to existing Flask ecosystem libraries.
* Encourage **community contributions** for specialized features (auth, caching, etc.).

## ‚ú® Vision Statement

FlaskNova is the bridge between **Flask‚Äôs simplicity** and **FastAPI‚Äôs modern features** ‚Äî a framework that gives Python developers the best of both worlds:

* The **freedom of Flask**.
* The **developer experience of FastAPI**.
* The **clarity of strong typing + schema validation**.
